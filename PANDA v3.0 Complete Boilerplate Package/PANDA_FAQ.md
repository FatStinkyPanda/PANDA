*Developed by FatStinkyPanda - Available at Github.com/FatStinkyPanda*

## General Questions

### Q: What is PANDA?
**A:** PANDA (Project Architecture & Networked Development Assistant) is a comprehensive documentation-driven development system that enables perfect project continuity across development sessions and AI models. It uses structured documentation as persistent memory.

### Q: Why do I need PANDA?
**A:** PANDA solves these problems:
- AI models forget context between sessions
- Documentation gets out of sync with code
- Task management becomes chaotic in large projects
- Different AI models can't continue each other's work
- Project knowledge gets lost over time

### Q: What makes PANDA v3.0 different from v2.0?
**A:** Version 3.0 introduces:
- Distributed task management (25 tasks per file)
- Hierarchical index system (100 entries per index)
- Automated project generation
- Master indexes for large projects
- Better cascade update system

### Q: Can I use PANDA without AI?
**A:** Yes! PANDA is an excellent project management system for human developers too. The structured approach to documentation and task management benefits any development process.

## Setup Questions

### Q: What files are absolutely required?
**A:** Minimum required files:
1. `PANDA_SYSTEM_v3.md` - System rules (reference)
2. `START_AI_DEVELOPMENT.txt` - AI instructions
3. `tasks/TODO.md` - Active tasks

Everything else can be generated from these.

### Q: How long does setup take?
**A:** 
- With initialization script: 2 minutes
- Manual setup: 5-10 minutes
- AI-driven setup: 15-30 minutes (includes initial tasks)

### Q: Can I customize the structure?
**A:** Yes, but keep core elements:
- Task management structure must remain
- Metadata system is required
- File limits should be respected
- Documentation cascade is essential

### Q: Do I need to use all features?
**A:** No. Start with basics:
1. Task management (TODO.md)
2. Basic documentation (README.md)
3. Add features as needed

## Task Management Questions

### Q: Why limit tasks to 25 per file?
**A:** This limit ensures:
- Files remain manageable
- Quick loading and processing
- Easy navigation
- Optimal AI context usage
- Version control efficiency

### Q: What happens when a task file fills up?
**A:** PANDA automatically:
1. Marks current file as full
2. Creates next numbered file
3. Updates indexes
4. Continues seamlessly

### Q: How do I handle subtasks?
**A:** Two approaches:
1. List subtasks within main task description
2. Create separate tasks with dependency references

### Q: Can I change task priorities after creation?
**A:** Yes. Update in TODO.md and document the change reason. Priority changes are part of normal workflow.

### Q: What if I have more than 100 index entries?
**A:** The system automatically:
1. Archives current index
2. Creates new index file
3. Updates master index
4. Maintains all history

## AI Development Questions

### Q: Which AI models work best with PANDA?
**A:** Recommended models:
- **GPT-4** or newer (OpenAI)
- **Claude 3** or newer (Anthropic)
- **Large context models** (100k+ tokens)
- Any model understanding markdown and code

### Q: How do I ensure AI follows PANDA?
**A:** Key strategies:
1. Always have AI read `PANDA_SYSTEM_v3.md` first
2. Provide complete context
3. Correct mistakes immediately
4. Use explicit instructions

### Q: What if AI ignores PANDA rules?
**A:** Common fixes:
```
"You must follow PANDA v3.0 protocols. Please read PANDA_SYSTEM_v3.md 
and correct your approach."
```

### Q: Can multiple AIs work on the same project?
**A:** Yes! This is PANDA's strength. Each AI reads documentation and continues from current state. No handoff needed.

### Q: How much context should I provide?
**A:** Include:
- All PANDA system files
- Current task files
- Recent completed tasks
- Relevant code files
- Don't include entire codebase

## Documentation Questions

### Q: How detailed should metadata be?
**A:** Metadata should include:
- File purpose (required)
- Dependencies (required)
- Integration points (required)
- Everything else as relevant

Aim for useful, not exhaustive.

### Q: When do I update README.md?
**A:** Update when:
- Features are completed
- Architecture changes
- Status changes significantly
- Sprint completes
- Major milestones reached

### Q: What's the difference between README.md and MAIN_README.md?
**A:** 
- **MAIN_README.md**: Project vision/blueprint (rarely changes)
- **README.md**: Current state/progress (frequently updated)

### Q: Do test files need metadata?
**A:** Yes, but lighter weight. Focus on:
- What is being tested
- Test approach
- Special requirements

### Q: How do I handle generated files?
**A:** Generated files typically don't need metadata. Document the generator instead.

## Workflow Questions

### Q: How do I handle urgent tasks?
**A:** Add to TODO.md with CRITICAL priority. PANDA supports priority-based task selection.

### Q: What if I work on tasks out of order?
**A:** That's fine! Update task status accordingly. PANDA is flexible about execution order.

### Q: How do I handle external blockers?
**A:** Move blocked tasks to PENDING with clear explanation of:
- What's blocking
- What's needed
- Who to contact
- Expected resolution

### Q: Can I delete old completed tasks?
**A:** Archive, don't delete:
1. Create archive directory
2. Move old COMPLETED files there
3. Update indexes to note archival
4. Keep for historical reference

### Q: How often should I review pending tasks?
**A:** Recommended schedule:
- Daily: Quick scan for unblocked items
- Weekly: Detailed review
