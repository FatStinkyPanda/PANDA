```

### Configuration Files
```

- **EXAMPLE_TODO.md** - Demonstrates task formatting
- **EXAMPLE_METADATA.md** - Template for metadata files

## Quick Start for Humans

### Step 1: Copy Required Files
Copy these files to your project root:
- PANDA_SYSTEM_v3.md
- START_AI_DEVELOPMENT.txt
- AI_CONTINUATION_SCRIPT.txt
- Task structure templates

### Step 2: Initialize Your Project
1. Create your project's MAIN_README.md using the template
2. Set up the tasks/ directory structure
3. Configure .panda/config.json for your project
4. Create initial TODO.md with your first tasks

### Step 3: Start Development
Give an AI model this simple instruction:
```
Please read START_AI_DEVELOPMENT.txt and begin developing this project using the PANDA v3.0 system.
```

## Quick Start for AI Models

### Initial Project Setup
When given a new project with PANDA files:
1. Read PANDA_SYSTEM_v3.md to understand the complete system
2. Read START_AI_DEVELOPMENT.txt for project-specific instructions
3. Check for existing TODO.md or create one if missing
4. Begin systematic development following PANDA protocols

### Continuing Development
Use the provided AI_CONTINUATION_SCRIPT.txt or simply:
```
Read START_AI_DEVELOPMENT.txt if you haven't already. Continue development using the PANDA system. Work autonomously until the project is production ready.
```
