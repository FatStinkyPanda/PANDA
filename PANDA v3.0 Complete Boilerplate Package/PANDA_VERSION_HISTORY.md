## Migration Guides

### From v2.0 to v3.0

#### Breaking Changes
1. **File Structure**: Tasks now in separate numbered files
2. **Index System**: New index files required
3. **Configuration**: `.panda/config.json` now required

#### Migration Steps
1. Run migration script: `panda-migrate --path ./project`
2. Or manually:
   - Split PENDING.md into PENDING_001.md, PENDING_002.md, etc.
   - Split COMPLETED.md similarly
   - Create index files
   - Add configuration

#### Compatibility
- v3.0 can read v2.0 structure
- Automated migration available
- No data loss during migration

### From v1.0 to v3.0
- Recommend migrating to v2.0 first
- Or use fresh v3.0 setup and import tasks
