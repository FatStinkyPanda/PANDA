## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. AI Model Issues

#### Issue: "AI doesn't understand PANDA system"
**Symptoms**: 
- AI creates tasks incorrectly
- Documentation not being updated
- Files created without metadata

**Solutions**:
```
1. Ensure AI reads PANDA_SYSTEM_v3.md first:
   "Please read PANDA_SYSTEM_v3.md completely before proceeding."

2. Provide full context:
   "This project uses PANDA v3.0. Read START_AI_DEVELOPMENT.txt 
    for instructions on how to proceed."

3. Use a more capable model:
   - GPT-4 or better
   - Claude 3 or better
   - Models with 100k+ context
```

#### Issue: "AI loses context between sessions"
**Symptoms**:
- AI doesn't remember previous work
- Asks for information already provided
- Restarts tasks already completed

**Solutions**:
```
1. Always start sessions with:
   "Continue development using PANDA v3.0. Read README.md 
    to understand current state."

2. Point to documentation:
   "All project information is in the files. Check tasks/completed/ 
    for recent work."

3. Be explicit about continuity:
   "You previously worked on this. Check COMPLETED tasks 
    to see what's been done."
```

#### Issue: "AI creates placeholder code"
**Symptoms**:
- Code with TODO comments
- Functions that just return null
- Placeholder text in files

**Solutions**:
```
1. Reinforce quality standards:
   "PANDA requires production-ready code only. No placeholders 
    or TODOs in code."

2. Be specific in requirements:
   "Implement complete functionality with error handling, 
    not just structure."

3. Reference directive:
   "As stated in PANDA_SYSTEM_v3.md DIRECTIVE DELTA: 
    Production-ready code only."
```

### 2. Task Management Issues

#### Issue: "Tasks not moving to correct files"
**Symptoms**:
- Completed tasks still in TODO.md
- No entries in COMPLETED files
- Task tracking inconsistent

**Solutions**:
```
1. Remind AI about task flow:
   "When completing a task, move it from TODO.md to 
    tasks/completed/COMPLETED_XXX.md with full details."

2. Check file limits:
   - Ensure task files haven't exceeded 25 tasks
   - New files should be created automatically

3. Manual correction if needed:
   "Please move all completed tasks from TODO.md to 
    the appropriate COMPLETED file."
```

#### Issue: "Task IDs are inconsistent"
**Symptoms**:
- Duplicate task IDs
- Non-sequential numbering
- Missing ID prefixes

**Solutions**:
```
1. Establish naming convention:
   "Use consistent task IDs: [PROJECT-PREFIX-###]"

2. Request cleanup:
   "Please review and fix all task IDs to follow 
    the pattern: PROJ-001, PROJ-002, etc."

3. Add to project standards:
   Include ID format in MAIN_README.md
```

#### Issue: "Index files not updating"
**Symptoms**:
- PENDING_INDEX.md out of date
- Missing task entries
- Wrong file counts

**Solutions**:
```
1. Request index rebuild:
   "Please rebuild PENDING_INDEX.md by scanning all 
    PENDING_XXX.md files."

2. Check automation settings:
   Verify .panda/config.json has "autoIndex": true

3. Manual update:
   "Update all index files to reflect current task 
    distribution."
```

---

### 3. Documentation Issues

#### Issue: "Metadata files missing"
**Symptoms**:
- Code files without corresponding metadata
- Empty metadata directory
- Incomplete documentation

**Solutions**:
```
1. Enforce metadata creation:
   "Every code file needs a metadata file. Create any 
    missing metadata documentation."

2. Batch creation:
   "Scan all source files and create metadata for any 
    that are missing."

3. Add to task requirements:
   Include "Create metadata" in task acceptance criteria
```

#### Issue: "README.md not staying current"
**Symptoms**:
- README shows old information
- New features not documented
- Status indicators wrong

**Solutions**:
```
1. Regular sync request:
   "Update README.md to reflect all recent changes 
    and current project status."

2. Automated updates:
   "After each sprint, update README.md with completed 
    features and new statistics."

3. Distinguish from MAIN_README:
   "Remember: MAIN_README.md is the blueprint (stable), 
    README.md is current state (changes)."
```

#### Issue: "Documentation too verbose/repetitive"
**Symptoms**:
- Extremely long metadata files
- Repeated information
- Difficult to find key details

**Solutions**:
```
1. Request concise updates:
   "Keep documentation comprehensive but concise. 
    Avoid repetition."

2. Use templates strictly:
   "Follow PANDA_TEMPLATES.md format exactly without 
    adding extra sections."

3. Focus on essentials:
   "Document what's unique about each file, not 
    general concepts."
```

### 4. File Organization Issues

#### Issue: "Project structure becoming messy"
**Symptoms**:
- Files in wrong directories
- Inconsistent naming
- Missing directory structure

**Solutions**:
```
1. Request reorganization:
   "Please reorganize files according to the structure 
    defined in MAIN_README.md."

2. Enforce conventions:
   "All files must follow the naming conventions: 
    kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components."

3. Regular cleanup:
   "Review and fix any files that don't follow our 
    structure standards."
```

#### Issue: "Task files growing too large"
**Symptoms**:
- PENDING_001.md has more than 25 tasks
- Slow file loading
- Difficult to navigate

**Solutions**:
```
1. Trigger file split:
   "PENDING_001.md has exceeded 25 tasks. Create 
    PENDING_002.md and move overflow tasks."

2. Check automation:
   Verify .panda/config.json limits are set correctly

3. Manual redistribution:
   "Redistribute tasks across multiple files maintaining 
    25 per file limit."
```

### 5. Quality Issues

#### Issue: "Code quality declining"
**Symptoms**:
- No error handling
- Missing types
- Poor performance

**Solutions**:
```
1. Reinforce standards:
   "All code must meet our quality standards: full error 
    handling, TypeScript types, optimized performance."

2. Request review:
   "Review recent code and fix any quality issues: missing 
    error handling, any types, performance problems."

3. Add quality gates:
   "Run linting and type checking on all code. Fix any 
    issues found."
```

#### Issue: "Tests not being written"
**Symptoms**:
- Low test coverage
- No test files created
- Features without tests

**Solutions**:
```
1. Include in task requirements:
   "Every feature task must include comprehensive tests. 
    Minimum 90% coverage."

2. Dedicated test tasks:
   "Create tasks specifically for increasing test coverage 
    of existing code."

3. Test-first approach:
   "Write tests before implementation following TDD 
    principles."
```

### 6. Performance Issues

#### Issue: "AI taking too long to respond"
**Symptoms**:
- Long processing times
- Timeouts
- Incomplete responses

**Solutions**:
```
1. Break down work:
   "Focus on one task at a time rather than multiple 
    tasks simultaneously."

2. Reduce context:
   "Only include relevant files for current task, not 
    entire project."

3. Incremental updates:
   "Complete and document each task before moving to 
    the next."
```

#### Issue: "Large files causing problems"
**Symptoms**:
- Files over 100KB
- Slow processing
- Context window issues

**Solutions**:
```
1. Split large files:
   "Break this large file into smaller, logical modules."

2. Compress documentation:
   "Summarize verbose sections while keeping essential 
    information."

3. Archive old content:
   "Move historical information to archive files."
```

### 7. Integration Issues

#### Issue: "Cascade updates not happening"
**Symptoms**:
- Related files not updated
- Integration points broken
- Metadata out of sync

**Solutions**:
```
1. Manual cascade:
   "This change affects multiple files. Update all related 
    files and metadata."

2. Integration checklist:
   "For each change, check: metadata updated? dependent 
    files updated? indexes current?"

3. Verification:
   "Verify all integration points are properly documented 
    and working."
```

#### Issue: "Cross-references broken"
**Symptoms**:
- Task references pointing to non-existent tasks
- File paths incorrect
- Links not working

**Solutions**:
```
1. Reference audit:
   "Scan all documentation and fix any broken cross-references."

2. Path verification:
   "Verify all file paths in documentation match actual 
    file locations."

3. Link testing:
   "Test all links in documentation and fix any that 
    are broken."
```
